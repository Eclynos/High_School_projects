## Parralel_worlds

# Parralel worlds is a survival isometric game coded in python with pygame library.
This game is not over and has no goal yet. I did all the graphics and animations myself.
It's a survival game where you can break obstacles pick them up and build things with them. For now the only craft available is a bridge.

Then I picked them up and they added to my inventory.
