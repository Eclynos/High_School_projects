# Excitebike

### Excitebike is a remake of the retro game of the same name where the principle is to set the best time (solo).
### This game as been released in october/november 2022 in python with [Pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel).
### I did all the graphics and animations myself with the [Pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel) pixel editor.
### There is 2 tracks, one in a stadium by day and the other on a beach at night where the moon follows the player.
