# Parralel_worlds

### Parralel worlds is a survival isometric game coded in python with [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/docs/) library.
### I did all the graphics and animations myself with [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/).
### This game is not over and has no goal yet. I'm working on a second game using this game's engine.
### It's a survival game where you can break obstacles pick them up and build things with them. For now the only craft available is a bridge.

### Here I broke all the objects around.

### Then I picked them up and they added to my inventory.

### I can put the pieces of bridge that I crafted where there is space.

### My character is hidden if he goes behind an object.
